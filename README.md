# DnDBeyond_NPC_Generator
Senior Design Project. Create an NPC (non-playable character) Generator for DnDBeyond. Includes files, as well as Milestone presentations.

This project was in collaboration with DnDBeyond to create an NPC Generator that allows users to access an NPC storage webpage called 'MyNPCs' to create a NPC, either custom, random, or by importing an already made playable character. After creating an NPC, the user has access to the NPC sheet on a webpage called 'NPCDisplay', allowing an interactive and user friendly experience for the NPC, modeled after DnDBeyond's character sheet webpage. The function is to make NPC data and sheets more lively from their counterpart, that is just a static text block. Features include: trackable data (spells, items, etc.), hideable UI elements, and easy customization of an NPC for a user. 

Aside from myself, the team included Brion Gahl (https://github.com/BrionGahl) and Prem Rana (https://github.com/ranamerp), as well as collaboration with Patrick Backmann (Project Manager) and Jason Bush (Software Developer) from DnDBeyond for guidance.

My duties involved being the team leader, helping manage the Trello board, design of the NPCDisplay sheet and websites, the creation and styling of the websites, and the design, styling, and some of the content of the Milestone presentations.
